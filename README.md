Movie Recommendation System (ML-Based)
This project is a Machine Learning-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar movies based on user input. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and cosine similarity to find movies with similar content.

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
Machine Learning (Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF, CountVectorizer)
Data Processing & Feature Engineering
Flask (For Web Deployment)

Dataset:
tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv (IMDb-like movie dataset)

How It Works:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and merging movie metadata.
Feature Engineering: Extracting keywords, genres, and cast.
Vectorization: Using TF-IDF/CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical format.
Similarity Calculation: Applying Cosine Similarity to find the most relevant movies.
User Input: Enter a movie name, and the system returns the top similar movies.
